#### Confession
- 🔭 I’m currently working on getting paid to write code and build stuff **full-time** wearing cool company T-Shirts.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [Distributed Systems](https://yngyuan.github.io/post/distributed-system-in-one-lesson/) and [Serverless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on fun but useless projects. There are too many useful things out there.
- 💬 Ask me about [anything](https://yngyuan.github.io/categories/). We can always learn from others, right?
