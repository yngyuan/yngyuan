#### Confession
- 🔭 I’m currently working on getting paid to write code and build stuff **full-time** wearing cool tech company T-Shirts.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [Distributed Systems](https://yngyuan.github.io/post/distributed-system-in-one-lesson/) and [Serverless Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on fun but useless projects. Too many useful things out there already, huh?
- 💬 Ask me about [anything](https://yngyuan.github.io/categories/), for I am interested in all tricks of trades from UX design, software development to product management and digital marketing.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: Plays a little bit of [music](https://space.bilibili.com/336791775).
